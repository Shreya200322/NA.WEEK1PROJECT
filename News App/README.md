# News Application

This project is a News Application built using React for the client-side and ExpressJS for the server-side. It allows users to view and interact with news articles fetched from a database or an external API.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

### Client

The `client` directory contains the React application.

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file for the React application.
- **src/components/App.js**: The root component that manages the layout and routing.
- **src/App.js**: The main entry point that renders the App component.
- **src/index.js**: The entry point for the React application that renders the App component into the DOM.
- **src/styles/App.css**: CSS styles for the App component.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for the client-side application.

### Server

The `server` directory contains the ExpressJS application.

- **src/controllers/newsController.js**: Functions to handle requests related to news articles.
- **src/routes/newsRoutes.js**: Routes for news-related endpoints.
- **src/models/newsModel.js**: Data model for news articles.
- **src/app.js**: Entry point for the Express server, setting up middleware and routes.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for the server-side application.
